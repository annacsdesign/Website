                    Since September 2018, I've served as Penwizard's sole visual designer. As part of a small and fairly new business, my role has included everything from developing a flexible branding system to rolling out seasonal campaigns and book launches to improving UI and UX on Penwizard's website.<br><br>

                    Since there had never been a designer at Penwizard before me, there was no identity to speak of when I started aside from a logo and a single shade of teal. I developed a flexible color scheme, type system, and other rules to dictate the look and feel of the company’s website, emails, internal materials, and evergreen marketing.<br><br>

                    As an ecommerce company focused on gifting for early readers, a crucial part of Penwizard’s business model is marketing for holidays such as Mother’s and Father’s Day, Christmas, Easter, and Valentine’s Day. Seasonal creative includes social media posts and stories, Mailchimp email campaigns, web banners, Facebook and Google ads, and more.<br><br>

                    Many of Penwizard’s featured offerings are books from beloved children’s brands such as LEGO, Peppa Pig, PAW Patrol, and The Snowman. Promoting these titles requires careful adherence to each parent company’s brand guidelines. One of my central responsibilities is working closely with these brand partners to make sure both sides approve of creative and marketing goals have been met or surpassed.<br><br>

                    Using new brand colors, improved graphics and SEO insights, I’ve significantly updated Penwizard’s user interface and improved web rankings over time. When our developer team was cut in half shortly after our website was completely overhauled, I was able to put my coding skills to use getting our homepage and product pages on brand and optimized for mobile. The changes include overhauling the color themes for clearer navigation, replacing all thumbnails and product images with newly inviting and optimized ones, and spearheading a push to update all website copy for SEO and clarity.<br><br>
