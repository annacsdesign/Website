                    Since September 2018, I've served as Penwizard's sole visual designer. As part of a small and fairly new business, my role has included everything from developing a flexible branding system to rolling out seasonal campaigns and book launches to improving UI and UX on Penwizard's website.<br><br>

                    Since there had never been a designer at Penwizard before me, there was no identity to speak of when I arrived aside from a logo and a single shade of teal. I developed a flexible color scheme, type system, and other rules to dictate the look and feel of the company’s website, emails, internal materials, and evergreen marketing.<br><br>
                    
                    The identity needed to feel modern and professional but informal, be flexible enough to work with any of the art styles and color palettes of Penwizard's books, and be adaptable for holiday campaigns. Aside from these formal needs, my guiding motivation was to create a brand that conveyed warmth and celebration. It was important to the team to utilize the brand to communicate familiarly with new and existing customers across all platforms. Penwizard has a team of around ten people, so few that if one customer's book goes missing in the mail, a majority of the staff might hear about it and want to help remedy the situation. That level of care, less likely to be found at Penwizard's competitors, inspired me to build imagery and type treatments that consistently spoke of generosity: from the employees to their customers, and from parents buying books for their happy children. <br><br>

                    As an ecommerce company focused on gifting for early readers, a crucial part of Penwizard’s business model is marketing for holidays such as Mother’s and Father’s Day, Christmas, Easter, and Valentine’s Day. Seasonal creative includes social media posts and stories, Mailchimp email campaigns, web banners, Facebook and Google ads, and more.<br><br>

                    Many of Penwizard’s featured offerings are books from beloved children’s brands such as LEGO, Peppa Pig, PAW Patrol, and The Snowman. Promoting these titles requires careful adherence to each parent company’s brand guidelines. One of my central responsibilities is working closely with these brand partners to make sure both sides approve of creative and marketing goals have been met or surpassed.<br><br>

                    Using new brand colors, improved graphics and SEO insights, I’ve significantly updated Penwizard’s user interface and improved web rankings over time. When our developer team was cut in half shortly after our website was completely overhauled, I was able to put my coding skills to use getting our homepage and product pages on brand and optimized for mobile. The changes include overhauling the color themes for clearer navigation, replacing all thumbnails and product images with newly inviting and optimized ones, and spearheading a push to update all website copy for SEO and clarity.<br><br>
