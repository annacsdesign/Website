                    As an exercise in frame-by-frame animation and illustration, I created a short video showcasing the public sculpture collection spread across WWU's campus. 
                    Many of the artists in the collection are reknowned in their field. However, the nature of most of the sculptures &#40;minimal, neutral colors, simple forms&#41; and their scattered locations on campus mean that thousands of students walk past them everyday without a second glance.<br><br>
                    
                    Several of the most well-known pieces on campus are often sat on, walked over, or swung from, and I wanted to play with the idea that this collection turns our hundred-year-old university into a playground of sorts. I opted to forgo the quiet Pacific Northwest colors of campus and draw the sculptures as bright, prominent forms.
